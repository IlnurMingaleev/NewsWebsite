A ground-based test of the Super Heavy rocket that is intended to boost a Starship upper stage into orbit ended in flames on Monday afternoon at SpaceX's launch site in South Texas. A fire burned in the vicinity of the pad, on and off, for more than an hour. This is the first time SpaceX has tested a booster stage—this one bears the designation Booster 7—equipped with a full complement of 33 Raptor rocket engines. Monday's test was not intended to lead to a static fire test, during which the engines are briefly ignited, so seeing fire erupt from the aft end of the vehicle at 4:20 pm CT local time was a surprise. The methane-fueled Raptor engine has a complicated sequence of events that must unfold precisely in order for it to ignite, and SpaceX was testing the \"spin start\" portion of this ignition sequence when the anomaly occurred. Something must have caused methane propellant to ignite, with the ambient oxygen in the air serving as an oxidizer, inside the vehicle.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments","pubDate":"2022-07-12 15:40:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"arstechnica","country":["united states of america","india","canada"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Nordisk Games acquires The Quarry developer Supermassive Games","link":"https://www.trueachievements.com/n50344/supermassive-games-aquired-by-nordisk-games","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Quarry, Until Dawn, and The Dark Pictures Anthology dev acquired","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-12 15:39:59","image_url":"https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/carousel/110951.jpg","source_id":"trueachievements","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia","singapore","canada"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The best Amazon Prime Day SSD deals","link":"https://www.pcgamer.com/amazon-prime-day-ssd-deals-2022","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Amazon Prime day is here and there are already a bunch of great Prime Day SSD deals.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-12 15:37:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"pcgamer","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","australia","canada"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Nothing Phone (1) unboxing and first impressions: Cyberpunk cousin of the Pixel 5 [Video]","link":"https://9to5google.com/2022/07/12/nothing-phone-1-first-impressions/","keywords":null,"creator":["Damien Wilde"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brand-new Android OEMs are few and far between, which is why the arrival of the Nothing Phone (1) is an interesting time for the mobile OS.

(credit: Volkswagen) Volkswagen is in the midst of a huge electrification effort, spurred on by a combination of dieselgate and stringent fleet emissions targets in Europe. Last week, the company broke ground on the first of six European battery factories and is actively looking at building one or more similar plants here in the US. If and when that happens, Volkswagen may well make those batteries using material recycled from older electric vehicle batteries, thanks to a new collaboration with Redwood Materials. \"Redwood Materials is a great partner to help us accelerate EV adoption in America. This collaboration allows us to move closer toward our goal of closing the loop for a circular EV economy, giving American consumers yet another reason to go electric,\" said Scott Keogh, president and CEO of VW Group of America. As we explored yesterday, the lithium-ion battery in an electric vehicle should see little loss of storage capacity over the course of a decade. But eventually, batteries will degrade to the point where it makes more sense to repurpose them as static storage (once they can only hold 60–70 percent of their original charge) or eventually recycle them.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments","pubDate":"2022-07-12 15:25:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"arstechnica","country":["united states of america","india","canada"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bandai Namco reportedly hacked by ransomware group","link":"https://www.pcgamer.com/bandai-namco-reportedly-hacked-by-ransomware-group","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The story remains unconfirmed, but the publisher is staying ominously quiet.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-12 15:16:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"pcgamer","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","australia","canada"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Download and Install iOS 16 Public Beta on Your iPhone Today.
